## To-Do List
This is a to-do list app using a GUI(tkinter) where the user can create, update and track their to-do list.
First thing I did was to import tkinter. 
Then i created a main window using the tkinter's Tk() function, i added a text widget using the tkinter's Text() function to allow users to type tasks. 

Finally, i added buttons using the tkinter's Button() function to give users options like creating tasks, deleting tasks, and updating tasks.


## Password Generator
This a password generator app  which prompts the user to specify the desired length of the password.
I built a password generator by first defining the desired password length. Then, I created a character set that included uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special symbols.I selected characters from the set and combined them to generate random passwords. I repeated this process until the desired number of passwords was generated. Finally, I provided the generated passwords to the user, ensuring they met their security needs.


## Calculator
This is a calculator app using tkinter which prompts the user to perform basic arithmetic operations.
I started by importing the tkinter library in Python.

After setting up the basic tkinter window, I designed the user interface by adding buttons for numbers and operators.

To handle user input and button clicks, I created functions that were linked to each button. For instance, I wrote functions for digits 0-9 and operators like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

To ensure the calculator performs arithmetic operations correctly, I implemented the logic for evaluating expressions entered by the user. I used Python's built-in eval() function to calculate results.

I also incorporated functionality to clear the screen when the "C" button was pressed, enabling users to start a new calculation.

Finally, I organized the layout of the tkinter widgets, set the window title, and ran the main event loop to make the calculator app interactive, allowing users to input calculations and view results in a user-friendly graphical interface.
